# Purpose
Recreate chess app.

# Dependencies
- chess.js
- react dnd

- need to use older versions of react and react dnd or will have some issues.
  - attempted to write with newest versions and kept getting errors with solutions to use older versions.

- need to use FEN notation (Forsyth-Edwards Notation)
